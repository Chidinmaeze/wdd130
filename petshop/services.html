    [We understand that your furry companions are more than just pets—they're cherished members of your family. At DOG WORLD, we are on a mission to provide a unique blend of luxury, comfort, and style for your beloved pets.
    My experience as a dog owner opened my eye to the problem of assessing quality dog food and accessories within my immediate environment, Ilesa Town in Osun State. Dog owners go as far as the state capital (a return journey of 120 minutes), to buy quality feeds and accessories, exposing them to the life risk of road travelling, time consuming and higher cost of purchase as a result of excessive transport cost. 
    Looking to solve these challenges, I ventured into one-stop retail business that provides high quality dog needs (food, accessories, veterinary services, kennels, feeders etc) at affordable prices. We educate and assist dog owners in our quest to improve the lives of their cherished dogs; creating healthier dogs and happier dog owners. Our home delivery services cover both private and commercial dog owners, including the private security outfits within the town.
    Our Story: Founded in 2017,Dog World was born out of a deep love for our furry pets and a desire to offer dog owners the best in terms of products and services. Our journey began with a vision to create an haven where dog lovers would be able to discover the finest in pet fashion, accessories, and lifestyle products.]
