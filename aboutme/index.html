    <h2>Chichi</h2>
    <p>Hi good day everyone, I am Chidinma Eze from Nigeria, a mother of four kids (3 are biological). I love to travel (when I have the means to so feel free to invite me over for holiday in your country), I love to learn new skills and I am here to learn to be a Software Engineer.  </p>
    <p>I am so glad I am finally getting an opportunity to understand how web design works. I pray God enables me to learn it properly so I can get a better job to take care of my kids, beloved mother and the less privileged in my community.</p>
    <p>I am a Presbyterian member and love to sing, dance and play. I love to make people happy and I see God helping me start my NGO in the nearest future to assist orphans, vulnerable children and women here in Nigeria</p>
